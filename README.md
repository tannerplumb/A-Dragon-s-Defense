# A Dragon's Defense
 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate Unity, C#, and Game Development skills. This project is intended to be a Tower Defense game, demonstrating basic Tower Defense mechanics, in Unity, and is targeted at Web Browsers (WebGL). It is my Senior Project for my B.S. in Software Engineering. Note that some things were done very inefficiently here, namely the creation of towers/enemies. There should be much more inheritance than what is currently present.
